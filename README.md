"# CS-210-Project-1-Clock" 

•Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

Users of this project can view and manage a 12-hour and 24-hour clock. The project presents a menu where the user can change the displayed time based on their choices. Both the 12-hour and 24-hour time formats are displayed to the user once they make a selection from the menu. 

•What did you do particularly well?

I believe I have done well of making sure that the main method handles all input and output and that the clock methods do not contain any input or output.  

•Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I can improve my code by making the display menu more visually appealing and user-friendly and by updating it so that the menu's asterisks don't change shape according to the time of the clocks. 

•Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The code that handles the change in time from AM to PM and PM to AM was the part of the code that I found the most challenging to develop. I overcome this by consulting my reading from Zybooks and my instructor's guidance.  

•What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The use of header files and.cpp files is a skill that enhances code reusability and modularity. By separating the declaration in the header file from the implementation in the.cpp file, code can be readily transferred and reused across multiple.cpp files without having to duplicate the implementation code. This skill can be used to develop other projects and coursework.

•How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by giving variables and functions meaningful names that appropriately explain their function.To increase readability and code organization, complicated processes are broken down into smaller, well-named functions. Maintaining code readability while eliminating unnecessary duplication or complexities. I've also added comments to explain the program's purpose and behavior. Validating user input and dealing with edge cases to prevent unexpected program performance.
